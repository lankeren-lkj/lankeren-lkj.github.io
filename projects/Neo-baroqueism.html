      Personal project, 2025
    </p>

 <p>
The project was presented at <strong>SaloneSatellite in 2025</strong>, where its originality and distinctive visual language attracted significant attention. The work was personally visited and praised by leading figures including <strong>Maria Porro, President of Salone del Mobile</strong>, whose recognition played a key role in bringing the project wider visibility. This early reception directly led to a commercial collaboration with the Italian ceramics brand <a href="https://www.bosatrade.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Bosa Ceramiche</a>, marking an important step from experimental research to production.

The project is conceived as a modular system that explores the transformation of historical decorative language through contemporary design logic. Using a single hexagonal unit as its foundation, it translates complex ornamental references into a coherent, generative structure, allowing form, pattern and object to evolve from the same geometry. The work positions itself between art, design and architecture, emphasizing system thinking over fixed form.

During the exhibition, the project introduced an innovative interactive approach: the works were not only meant to be viewed, but also physically engaged with. Visitors were invited to assemble and recombine the modules, creating their own compositions directly within the exhibition space.
